    "#One-tailed and two-tailed tests are two ways of carrying out statistical significance tests of a characteristic, drawn from the population, with respect to the test statistic. A one-tailed test refers to a test of null hypothesis, in which the alternative hypothesis is articulated directionally.1 A two-tailed test allows you to determine if two means are different from one another.3 A two-tailed test will test both if the mean is significantly greater than x and if the mean significantly less than x. The mean is considered significantly different from x if the test statistic is in the top 2.5% or bottom 2.5% of its probability distribution, resulting in a p-value less than 0.05. Two-tailed tests can show evidence that the control and variation are different, whereas one-tailed tests can show evidence if variation is better than the control.2 The main difference between one-tailed and two-tailed tests is that one-tailed tests will only have one critical region, whereas two-tailed tests will have two critical regions.0"

    "#5   Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula for calculating conditional probability in probability and statistics.13 It follows the axioms of conditional probability, which is the probability of an event given that another event occurred.0 For example, if A gets a 3 on a die roll and B gets a jack of hearts from a well-shuffled deck of cards, then A and B are independent events. Let A and B be the two events associated with a random experiment. The probability of A's occurrence under the condition that B has already occurred and P(B) 0 is called the Conditional Probability.3 Bayes' theorem is slightly more nuanced and gives the actual probability of an event given information about tests.1 It links the degree of belief in a proposition before and after accounting for evidence. Bayes' theorem allows the risk to an individual of a known age to be assessed more accurately by conditioning it relative to their age, rather than simply assuming that the individual is typical of the population as a whole.2"

    "#6 A confidence interval is a range where we think a certain number (like an average) lies for the whole population, based on our sample data. The confidence level (like 95%) is how sure we are that this range includes the true value.2 Confidence intervals help navigate the uncertainty of how well a sample estimates a value for an entire population. Technically, you can create CIs using any confidence level between 0 and 100%, but the most common is 95%. Analysts occasionally use 99% and 90%. To construct the 95% confidence interval, we add/subtract 2 standard deviations from the mean.1 This interval would also contain about 95% of the sample pitches."
